Ames Housing Price Prediction
📊 Advanced Regression Modeling on Real Estate Data

This project builds predictive models to estimate house sale prices in Ames, Iowa using the well-known Ames Housing dataset. It involves feature engineering, data preprocessing, multicollinearity checks, and applying advanced regression models to optimize prediction performance.

📌 Project Highlights

    ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed 80+ features from the housing dataset

    🧠 Feature selection using correlation heatmaps & variance analysis

    🔍 Applied multiple models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and XGBoost

    📉 Evaluated models using RMSE, R², and cross-validation

    📊 Visualized residuals, feature importance, and predictions


🧰 Tech Stack

    Python, Pandas, NumPy

    Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib

    Jupyter Notebook
